## Description

In this repository there will be an agent with q-learning algorithm that will learn to play in various environments. From the simplest with hit or stay and infinite deck to the most complex with insurance and doubling.

## The goal

The goal of this repository is not to test whether an algorithm using q_learning can learn to play blackjack, but rather the effectiveness of this algorithm across various increasingly difficult environments and the reproduction of the fundamental strategy. Table that indicates, through mathematical and statistical studies, all the actions to be taken to conduct a safe game in a blackjack game. I will therefore focus on comparing these analyzes with those of the fundamental strategy and evaluating their effectiveness.

### How to Read the Blackjack Chart

The blackjack cheat sheet can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but you can quickly understand how it works by consulting solutions for each situation as you play blackjack. Unlike in real money slots, you have a choice to make after receiving the starting hand in blackjack.

In the leftmost column, you will find your hand, which can be a total value or a particular starting combo of two cards. After you identify this based on the hand you have been dealt, you need to check the dealer’s upcard at the top of the BJ chart.

Move to the corresponding position on the right and the box will show you the best possible move for that situation.

You can hit, stand, split, double down, or surrender according to the perfect blackjack chart. If doubling down or surrendering isn’t supported in the version of blackjack you are playing, you can simply hit or stand instead. It’s best to play games that permit doubling down and surrendering, so choosing the right blackjack table is important.
