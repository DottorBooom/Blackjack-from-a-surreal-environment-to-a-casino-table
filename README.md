## Description

In this repository there will be an agent with q-learning algorithm that will learn to play in various environments. From the simplest with hit or stay and infinite deck to the most complex with insurance and doubling.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is not to test whether an algorithm using q_learning can learn to play blackjack, but rather the effectiveness of this algorithm across various increasingly difficult environments and the reproduction of the fundamental strategy. Table that indicates, through mathematical and statistical studies, all the actions to be taken to conduct a safe game in a blackjack game. I will therefore focus on comparing these analyzes with those of the fundamental strategy and evaluating their effectiveness.
